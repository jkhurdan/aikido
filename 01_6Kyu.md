# 6th Kyu 
> [!NOTE]
> These are just my opinions, but as someone starting out, it feels like there's an entire world of things to learn and half of it is literally in another language. Aikido is a life long persuit, and how you learn it is going to differ with each stage of your journey. This is not something you will ever 'master', but always be working at refining. As you start out, be kind to yourself. Kyu test techniques aren't 'simple' techniques by any means.  

## Goals for this stage
At this stage our primary goal is to set ourself up with a strong foundation on how to learn aikido. Below is my recommendations on what you should focus on:
 * [Dojo Ettiquette](00_Getting_Started.md)
 * Ukemi - How to not get hurt as we receive techniques, and how to meet the mat in a controlled manner, as well as being able to get up off the mat in a controlled manner.
 * Tai Sabaki - Our basic body movements, including the stances we take in aikido
 * Attacks -  Basic attacks in aikido
 * Lastly you should start to be able to block out techniques. Meaning you have an understanding of the structure of aikido, and can understand this is Step 1, 2, and then 3, for example. At this stage you should be able to put broad shapes together, and are not focused on refined movements yet.
