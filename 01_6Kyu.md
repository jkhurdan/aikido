# 6th Kyu 
> [!NOTE]
> These are just my opinions, but as someone starting out, it feels like there's an entire world of things to learn and half of it is literally in another language. Aikido is a life long persuit, and how you learn it is going to differ with each stage of your journey. This is not something you will ever 'master', but always be working at refining. As you start out, be kind to yourself. Kyu test techniques aren't 'simple' techniques by any means.  

## Goals for this stage
At this stage our primary goal is to set ourself up with a strong foundation on how to learn aikido. Below is my recommendations on what you should focus on:
 * [Dojo Ettiquette](00_Getting_Started.md)
 * Ukemi - How to not get hurt as we receive techniques, and how to meet the mat in a controlled manner, as well as being able to get up off the mat in a controlled manner.
 * Tai Sabaki - Our basic body movements, including the stances we take in aikido
 * Attacks -  Basic attacks in aikido
 * Lastly you should start to be able to block out techniques. Meaning you have an understanding of the structure of aikido, and can understand this is Step 1, 2, and then 3, for example. At this stage you should be able to put broad shapes together, and are not focused on refined movements yet.

## Ukemi
There are several rules I have for ukemi. The first, and most important is rule 1- Don't get hurt. We'll be focusing on 2 main rules at this stage:

> [!Important] 
> Rule 1: **Don't get hurt.**  Don’t put yourself in a position to get hurt. It’s your responsibility to make sure you don’t get hurt and that includes, but is not limited to communicating you just want to take the stretch, or getting off the mat.
>
> Rule 7: You can have all the answers and still not the means to solve the problem. You can understand and know how to do something, but with out the targeted strength training, mobility exercises and necessary body work you’ll always be limited in your movements.

There are several excercises below we'll introduce that will help us condition the body to be able to get down and up off the mat in a controlled manner, whilst building core strength, leg strength, and hip mobility. I recommend learning it in this order to build those foundational skills.

**Standing Reverse lunge to back fall (traditional)**
<br> ! -- Need Video -- 
<br> In this technique, I want you to focus on making slow controlled movements. Do not try to rush through it. Each movement should be a 5 secondc count atleast. With this, we are learning to manage our body wieght, as well as use our momementum to come up off the matt.
<br> To do this, you'll start from a stand position and do a traditional reverse lunge as shown in the video. You'll tuck the back leg making an L shape with both your legs, and then controll your descent to the mat. This is going to be difficult at first not to just flop on your tail bone. From there you can lean back towards one side, and rock your body up along the other side. Exhale as your rock back and meet the mat. Important you do not want to rock on your spine. You'll use this momentum to come to a kneeling position. You'll kick the back leg out back to the position you were in for your lunge, and then press up with your back foot. This is one set. We'll do 5 sets of this.

**Standing Reverse lunge to ushiro yoko-kaiten**

<br> In this version, we are building on what we've done, and learning to stay round, and how to generate momemetum in our body to help us get up.
