# Getting Started
> [!NOTE]
> Please note, this project is a work in progress. The culture of each dojo may be different, and you should always defer to your local teacher for guideance. This guide is intended as a general starting point for those looking to start aikido


## What you need to train
* Aikido Doj (uniform). Typically you can buy this from your dojo. Some offer traditional heavy weight ones, while others offer more karate like style uniforms. You can also buy more premium ones from shops like [Tozando](https://photos.app.goo.gl/sd9WH5tUjX7jYuLQ7). If your uniform from your dojo comes with a draw string pants, We recommend the elastic karate pants, which you can buy cheap from Amzaon for cheap.
* It is okay to wear pants under your aikido pants (if you want). Many people will wear rash gaurds or other atheletic pants under it. The elastic pants tend to fit people better, and doesn't fall down as much as the drawstring pants that typical uniform sets come with.

## How to tie your belt
You'll see several ways that people might tie their belt. Below is a fairly standard way of doing so:

## Dojo Ettiqutte

### Before entering the dojo
* You should always strive to show up early to class, in order to get changed, and be on the mat (and warmed up) prior to class starting. At our dojo its okay to come late, we'd rather you come late than not come at all. If based on your schedule, you'll likely always arrive after the class has bowed in, you should let your sensei know so they can be aware of your curcumstance
* Most dojos have a cleaning routine. If you're able to help clean before or after, it is recommended you do so. The dojo is considered a shared space, that we want to keep clean for everyone
* When entering the door you should bow to the *Shomen* (the head of the dojo, where the *Kamiza* is, usually where O'Sensei's photo sits).
* When enering you should always remove your shoes. In japanese culture you're entering a sacred space and you don't want to bring any of the dirt from the outside world into it. (This also includes negative thoughts you bring into the space.)

### Getting on the Mat
* When stepping on and off the mat you should bow to the *Kamiza*. This is usually at the front of the training space, where the picture of O'Sensei (the founder of Aikido) sits.

### Lining up and bowing in
In our dojo, we do not line up in rank order, however in some dojo's you do. If you line up in rank order, the senior most student in on the right hand side (also called the joseki side). You should be in line before class begins, often times signaled by a gong or clap. You should sit in seiza, however keiza is also fine if your knees do not allow it. 

#### **Sitting in Seiza**

#### **Bowing process**

Sensei (your teacher) will typically bow to O'Sensei first, and then to the class. When you bow you will say:

Onegaishimasu (お願いします) pronounced roughly as "oh-neh-gah-ee-shee-mass," [Pronounciation](https://youtube.com/shorts/AW1qoKV351Y?si=pEnZwi3CSoiUMjgk)

This roughly translates to "please, I wish" refering to wishing to have a good class. Culturally this is said before doing many things. For example before playing chess you might wish to have a good game.
