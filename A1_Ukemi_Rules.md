# Appendix 1: Jason's Ukemi Rules
Below are rules I came up with for myself, as principles to remember as I take Ukemi. These are just my opinons. 

1. Don't get hurt. 
 Don’t put yourself in a position to get hurt. It’s your responsibility to make sure you don’t get hurt and that includes, but is not limited to communicating you just want to take the stretch, or getting off the mat.
2. If you are going to endevor in something that is outrageous, especially if it's dangerous you need someone who is knowledgeable and will take responsibility that things go right. It’s your responsibility as Nage to protect Uke, just as much as it is Ukes job to protect Nage
3. You are both Uke and Nage, until it is time to become Uke or Nage
4. The best position for you to be in, is the most advantageous position for you (to strike or to counter)
5. Musubi is tying yourself with your opponent. The movement that happens is a result of what both Nage and Uke is doing. That movement is just as much about listening to what your partner is doing, as it is being responsive to what they are doing.
6. Stability comes from structure and position; softness comes from your ability to relax even when things want to retract, awareness comes from dedicated practice and study; All three are necessary
7. You can have all the answers and still not the means to solve the problem. You can understand and know how to do something, but with out the targeted strength training, mobility exercises and necessary body work you’ll always be limited in your movements.
8. Don't do it like me
