# Getting Started
> [!NOTE]
> Please note, this project is a work in progress. The culture of each dojo may be different, and you should always defer to your local teacher for guideance. This guide is intended as a general starting point for those looking to start aikido


## What you need to train
* Aikido Doj (uniform). Typically you can buy this from your dojo. Some offer traditional heavy weight ones, while others offer more karate like style uniforms. You can also buy more premium ones from shops like [Tozando](https://photos.app.goo.gl/sd9WH5tUjX7jYuLQ7). If your uniform from your dojo comes with a draw string pants, We recommend the elastic karate pants, which you can buy cheap from Amzaon for cheap.
* It is okay to wear pants under your aikido pants (if you want). Many people will wear rash gaurds or other atheletic pants under it. The elastic pants tend to fit people better, and doesn't fall down as much as the drawstring pants that typical uniform sets come with. Especially if you wear some sort of atheletic pants under your aikido pants.

## How to tie your belt
You'll see several ways that people might tie their belt. Below is a fairly standard way of doing so:

## Dojo Ettiqutte

### Before entering the dojo
* You should always strive to show up early to class, in order to get changed, and be on the mat (and warmed up) prior to class starting. At our dojo its okay to come late, we'd rather you come late than not come at all. If based on your schedule, you'll likely always arrive after the class has bowed in, you should let your sensei know so they can be aware of your curcumstance
* Most dojos have a cleaning routine. If you're able to help clean before or after, it is recommended you do so. The dojo is considered a shared space, that we want to keep clean for everyone
* When entering the door you should bow to the *Shomen* (the head of the dojo, where the *Kamiza* is, usually where O'Sensei's photo sits).
* When enering you should always remove your shoes. In japanese culture you're entering a sacred space and you don't want to bring any of the dirt from the outside world into it. (This also includes negative thoughts you bring into the space.)

### Getting on the Mat
* When stepping on and off the mat you should bow to the *Kamiza*. This is usually at the front of the training space, where the picture of O'Sensei (the founder of Aikido) sits.

### Lining up and bowing in
In our dojo, we do not line up in rank order, however in some dojo's you do. If you line up in rank order, the senior most student in on the right hand side (also called the joseki side). You should be in line before class begins, often times signaled by a gong or clap. You should sit in seiza, however keiza (legs crossed in the back) is also fine if your knees do not allow it. 

#### **Sitting in Seiza**

#### **Bowing process**

Sensei (your teacher) will typically bow to O'Sensei first, and then to the class. When you bow you will say:

Onegaishimasu (お願いします) pronounced roughly as "oh-neh-gah-ee-shee-mass," [Pronounciation](https://youtube.com/shorts/AW1qoKV351Y?si=pEnZwi3CSoiUMjgk)

This roughly translates to "please, I wish" refering to wishing to have a good class. Culturally this is said before doing many things. For example before playing chess you might wish to have a good game.

#### **Notes on bowing**
When you sit in sieza, your back should be straight. When bow you should bow with a straight back by hinging at the hip. You'll place your left hand down first in front of you forming half a triangle with with thumb and fingers, then your right hand comes down completing the triangle, then proceed to bow. Placing the left hand first, would (in theory) block you from drawing your sword, which is an indication you mean no harm. The martial bow, is to continuously look at the person you are bowing to. In aikido, we keep our gaze looking at about half way from you and the person you are bowing to.

**important Cultural notes**

In Japan there's a cast system, where by the Shogun was greater than (>) Feudal Lords > Samurai > Merchants/farmers > ordinary citizens. As a result, the way you bow to someone above you (in this case Sensei is slightly different). When Sensei turns to bow to you, you should bow first, and you should bow deeper (lower) then s/he does. You'll wait until they begin to raise, and then you'll raise after. Most dojos are not as strict about these rules.

### If you arrive late
If you arrive after the class as bowed in, you'll wait in seiza on the edge of the mat, and wait to be waived on to the mat. Once Sensei has allowed you to come on to the mat, you'll bow to the Kamiza and say Onegaishmasu before begining practice.


## Other things you should know
* Never sit in front of the Kamiza (especially in front of O'sensei). It is seen as rude.
* You can sit cross legged, but never have the bottoms of your feet pointing towards O'Sensei (it is seen as rude)
* You should always let senpai go first when training, or doing anything in the dojo. There is one exception, where if you are called up to demonstrate then you would start the technique first (however even in those cases, you should offer senpai to go first - at which they'll say you should. The culture is overly polite.)
* Typically the junior most student will attack first, and the senior student will do the technique 4 times, and then you'll swtich.

### Bowing out/off the mat
When class is done you'll line up again. Sensei will repeat the same process of bowing to the Kamiza, and then to the class. This time you'll say:

"Domo arigato gozaimasu" (どうもありがとうございます). This is a formal and very polite Japanese phrase meaning "Thank you very much,". It is pronounced doh-moh ah-ree-gah-toh goh-zah-ee-mahs. [Present vs Past tense pronounciation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXB8gF5i2NI)

The same bowing rules apply. After you bow out, you'll then bow to your training partners. Afterwhich you'll face the kamiza and bow as you walk off the mat. At this point, you should help with cleaning.

## Advanced knowledge
### Parts of the dojo
* Shomen (Front): The main wall, often featuring a kamidana (small shrine) or tokonoma (alcove) for scrolls/flowers, representing the spiritual heart.
* Kamiza (Divine Seat): The most honored spot at the shomen, reserved for the head instructor or highest-ranking guests, symbolizing the spiritual focus.
* Joseki (Upper Seat): The right (east) side, where senior students (senpai) sit, holding more responsibility.
* Shimoza (Lower Seat): The south end, often near the entrance, for the lowest-ranked students (kohai).
* Shimoseki (Lower Seat): The left (west) side, facing the joseki, for other lower-grade students.
* Keikojo/Embujo (Training Floor): The central space where all actual training, techniques, and demonstrations (like kata) occur, emphasizing focus and sincerity.
